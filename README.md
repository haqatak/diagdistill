We propose ​Diagonal Distillation, a new method for making high-quality video generation much faster. Current methods are either too slow or create videos with poor motion and errors over time.

## Requirements
We tested this repo on the following setup:
* Nvidia GPU with at least 24 GB memory (RTX 4090, A100, and H100 are tested).
* Linux operating system.
* 64 GB RAM.

Other hardware setup could also work but hasn't been tested.

## Installation
Create a conda environment and install dependencies:
```
conda create -n dia python=3.10 -y
conda activate dia
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation
```

## Quick Start
### Download checkpoints
```
huggingface-cli download Wan-AI/Wan2.1-T2V-1.3B --local-dir-use-symlinks False --local-dir wan_models/Wan2.1-T2V-1.3B
huggingface-cli download Efficient-Large-Model/LongLive-1.3B --local-dir ./longlive_models
```

Note:
* **Our model works better with long, detailed prompts** since it's trained with such prompts. We will integrate prompt extension into the codebase (similar to [Wan2.1](https://github.com/Wan-Video/Wan2.1/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#2-using-prompt-extention)) in the future. For now, it is recommended to use third-party LLMs (such as GPT-4o) to extend your prompt before providing to the model.
* You may want to adjust FPS so it plays smoothly on your device.
* The speed can be improved by enabling `torch.compile`, [TAEHV-VAE](https://github.com/madebyollin/taehv/), or using FP8 Linear layers, although the latter two options may sacrifice quality. It is recommended to use `torch.compile` if possible and enable TAEHV-VAE if further speedup is needed.

### Inference
Example inference script using the chunk-wise autoregressive checkpoint trained with DMD:
```
bash inference.sh
```

## Training

### Diagonal Distillation Training 
```
bash train_init.sh
```
Our training run uses 600 iterations and completes in under 2 hours using 64 H100 GPUs. By implementing gradient accumulation, it should be possible to reproduce the results in less than 16 hours using 8 H100 GPUs.
